1. git init
2. pnpm init
3. npm create cloudflare@latest my-svelte-app -- --framework=svelte
3.1 do it one more time but in the right directory.
4. pnpm install
5. pnpm run dev --open
(Then realize that there is git in the super folder, oops)
6. Then look around the folders and files and realize that I dont want to use SvelteKit just now, but only just Svelte.
6.0.1 Go to cloudflare pages documentation and see by maybe there is a chance that maybe Vite 3 project is more what I want (https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-vite3-project/)
6.1 Look at the intro documentation for svelte and find the right commands using only svelte using vite (https://svelte.dev/docs/introduction#start-a-new-project-alternatives-to-sveltekit)
6.1.1 Look at that, a vite 3 site with svelte is more what I want. Its the same commands.
7. pnpm create vite@latest (new directory, choose svelte, no typscript, not sveltekit.)
8. git init (again ðŸ™„)
